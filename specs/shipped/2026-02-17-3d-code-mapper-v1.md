# Codebase Visualizer V1

## Context

Developers waste hours understanding unfamiliar codebases by reading files one-by-one. No open-source tool provides a 3D interactive graph of a TypeScript codebase at function-level granularity with both visual (browser) and programmatic (MCP) access. This npm package generates a 3D force-directed graph of files, functions, and their dependencies — served via a local web server for human exploration and an MCP server for LLM-assisted code understanding.

## Codebase Impact (MANDATORY)

| Area | Impact | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| `src/parser/` | CREATE | TypeScript AST parser — extracts files, functions, imports, exports, dependencies |
| `src/graph/` | CREATE | Graph builder — transforms parsed data into nodes + edges with metrics |
| `src/analyzer/` | CREATE | Graph analysis — PageRank, betweenness centrality, coupling, cohesion, tension, escape velocity |
| `src/server/` | CREATE | Express web server — serves 3D UI + REST API for graph data |
| `src/mcp/` | CREATE | MCP server — exposes graph queries as MCP tools for LLMs |
| `src/renderer/` | CREATE | Client-side 3D visualization — 3d-force-graph + Three.js |
| `src/cli.ts` | CREATE | CLI entry point — `npx codebase-visualizer ./src` |
| `package.json` | CREATE | Package config, bin entry, dependencies |
| `tsconfig.json` | CREATE | TypeScript config |
| `vitest.config.ts` | CREATE | Test runner config |

**Files:** 10+ create | 0 modify | 0 affected
**Reuse:** None (greenfield)
**Breaking changes:** None (new package)
**New dependencies:**
- `typescript` — AST parsing (official compiler API, no alternative matches accuracy)
- `3d-force-graph` — 3D force-directed graph rendering (wraps Three.js + d3-force-3d, 1.5k GitHub stars)
- `graphology` — graph data structure + algorithms (lightweight, TypeScript, good for analysis)
- `express` — web server (ubiquitous, minimal)
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` — MCP server SDK (official Anthropic SDK)
- `commander` — CLI framework (standard choice)
- `open` — open browser (cross-platform)

## User Journey (MANDATORY)

### Primary Journey

ACTOR: Developer exploring an unfamiliar TypeScript codebase
GOAL: Visually understand codebase structure, find important files/functions, identify bottlenecks
PRECONDITION: Node.js installed, target codebase exists on disk

1. User runs `npx codebase-visualizer ./src` (or `npx codebase-visualizer --mcp ./src` for LLM mode)
   -> System parses all `.ts`/`.tsx` files in `./src`
   -> System extracts files, exported functions, imports, dependencies
   -> User sees terminal: "Parsed 142 files, 387 functions, 612 dependencies"

2a. [Browser mode — default] System builds graph and starts web server
   -> System calculates metrics (PageRank, betweenness, coupling, cohesion, tension, escape velocity)
   -> System starts Express server on `localhost:3333`
   -> User sees terminal: "3D map ready at http://localhost:3333"

2b. [MCP mode — `--mcp` flag] System builds graph and starts stdio MCP server
   -> System calculates same metrics
   -> MCP server starts on stdio (no HTTP, no browser)
   -> Ready for LLM connections via MCP client config

3. Browser opens with 3D force-directed graph
   -> User sees nodes (files = large spheres, functions = small spheres)
   -> User sees edges (import links, colored by type)
   -> User sees node size proportional to importance (PageRank)

4. User interacts with the graph
   -> User rotates/zooms the 3D scene
   -> User clicks a node -> sees detail panel (file path, LOC, dependencies, dependents)
   -> User searches for a file/function name -> graph highlights matching nodes
   -> User sees color legend (file type, coupling level)

5. User switches between views using view selector
   -> User selects "Dependency Flow" -> graph re-layouts as top-down DAG
   -> User selects "Hotspot" -> nodes recolor by coupling/risk metric
   -> User selects "Focus" on a node -> everything except 2-hop neighborhood fades
   -> User selects "Force Analysis" -> modules show centripetal/centrifugal forces, tension files glow

6. User connects an LLM via MCP (stdio)
   -> User adds MCP config to their AI tool:

   Claude Code (~/.claude/settings.json):
   ```json
   { "mcpServers": { "codebase-visualizer": {
       "command": "npx", "args": ["codebase-visualizer", "--mcp", "./src"]
   }}}
   ```

   Cursor / VS Code (mcp.json):
   ```json
   { "servers": { "codebase-visualizer": {
       "command": "npx", "args": ["codebase-visualizer", "--mcp", "./src"]
   }}}
   ```

   -> LLM calls `codebase_overview` -> gets compact architecture summary
   -> LLM calls `file_context("src/auth/login.ts")` -> gets exports, imports, dependents, metrics
   -> LLM calls `find_hotspots(metric: "coupling", limit: 10)` -> gets riskiest files
   -> LLM calls `analyze_forces` -> gets cohesion, tension files, extraction candidates

POSTCONDITION: User has mental model of codebase architecture, knows key files and bottlenecks

### CLI Modes

```
npx codebase-visualizer <path>          # Browser mode (default) — opens 3D visualization
npx codebase-visualizer --mcp <path>    # MCP mode — stdio server for LLM integration
npx codebase-visualizer --help          # Usage info

Options:
  --mcp              Start as MCP stdio server (no browser, no HTTP)
  --port <number>    Web server port (default: 3333, browser mode only)
  --depth <number>   Max directory depth to parse (default: unlimited)
  --filter <glob>    Filter files to include (default: **/*.ts,**/*.tsx)
```

### Error Journeys

E1. Invalid path
   Trigger: User provides non-existent directory
   1. User runs `npx codebase-visualizer ./nonexistent`
      -> System checks path exists
      -> User sees error: "Directory not found: ./nonexistent"
   Recovery: User corrects path and re-runs

E2. Empty codebase (no TS files)
   Trigger: Directory has no `.ts`/`.tsx` files
   1. User runs `npx codebase-visualizer ./assets`
      -> System finds 0 parseable files
      -> User sees error: "No TypeScript files found in ./assets"
   Recovery: User points to correct directory

E3. Parse error in file
   Trigger: File has syntax errors or unsupported constructs
   1. System encounters parse error in `broken.ts`
      -> System logs warning: "Skipped broken.ts: SyntaxError at line 42"
      -> System continues parsing remaining files
   Recovery: Graceful degradation — partial graph rendered

E4. Port conflict
   Trigger: Port 3333 already in use
   1. System detects port conflict
      -> System tries next port (3334, 3335...)
      -> User sees "3D map ready at http://localhost:3334"
   Recovery: Auto-fallback to available port

### Edge Cases

EC1. Single file codebase: renders 1 node, no edges — still useful for function-level view
EC2. Circular dependencies: handled naturally by force-directed layout (cycles visible as loops)
EC3. Very large codebase (>1000 files): warn user, suggest `--depth` or `--filter` flag
EC4. Re-exports / barrel files: follow through to actual source
EC5. Dynamic imports: skip with warning (static analysis only)
EC6. No exported functions in a file: still show file node, mark as "leaf"

## Acceptance Criteria (MANDATORY)

### Must Have (BLOCKING - all must pass to ship)

## Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| TS compiler API is slow on large codebases (>1000 files) | HIGH | MEDIUM | Stream parsing, show progress bar, support `--filter` glob |
| 3D rendering chokes on large graphs (>5000 nodes) | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOD: cluster files by directory at high zoom, expand on zoom-in |
| MCP SDK has breaking changes or is poorly documented | MEDIUM | LOW | Pin SDK version, wrap in adapter layer |
| Force-directed layout produces tangled mess for large graphs | MEDIUM | HIGH | Cluster by directory, use DAG mode for hierarchical layout |
| Re-exports / barrel files create misleading graph | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Follow import chains to actual source file |
| npm package size too large (Three.js is big) | LOW | MEDIUM | Three.js is client-side only, tree-shake unused modules |

**Kill criteria:** If TypeScript compiler API cannot parse real-world codebases (Next.js, Express apps) with >80% accuracy within 30s, switch to tree-sitter. If 3d-force-graph cannot render 500+ nodes at >15fps, pivot to 2D with optional 3D mode.

## State Machine

**Status**: N/A - Stateless feature

**Rationale**: CLI is a one-shot pipeline: parse -> build -> serve. No persistent state transitions. The web server is stateless (serves pre-built graph data). MCP server is stateless (queries against in-memory graph).

```

                       skip + warn                                  try next port
```

## MCP Tools (Top 5 — LLM Output)

Designed for compact, structured output. Each tool returns JSON that fits in ~500-1000 tokens.

### 1. `codebase_overview` — "What is this codebase?"

The entry point. LLM calls this first to orient itself.

```
Input: none (or { depth: 1 })
Output: {
  name: "my-app",
  rootDir: "./src",
  totalFiles: 142,
  totalFunctions: 387,
  totalDependencies: 612,
  modules: [
    { path: "src/auth/", files: 12, loc: 1840, avgCoupling: 0.7 },
    { path: "src/api/",  files: 23, loc: 3200, avgCoupling: 0.4 },
    ...
  ],
  entryPoints: ["src/index.ts", "src/server.ts"],
  topDependedFiles: ["src/utils/helpers.ts (47 dependents)", ...],
  metrics: { avgLOC: 89, maxDepth: 7, circularDeps: 3 }
}
```

**Why this matters for LLMs:** Gives immediate context without reading any files. LLM knows what modules exist, what's big, what's central.

### 2. `file_context` — "Tell me everything about this file"

The "spotlight" tool. LLM calls this when reasoning about a specific file.

```
Input: { filePath: "src/auth/login.ts" }
Output: {
  path: "src/auth/login.ts",
  loc: 142,
  exports: [
    { name: "loginUser", type: "function", loc: 45 },
    { name: "LoginParams", type: "type", loc: 8 }
  ],
  imports: [
    { from: "src/db/users.ts", symbols: ["findUser", "User"] },
    { from: "src/auth/hash.ts", symbols: ["verifyPassword"] }
  ],
  dependents: [
    { path: "src/api/auth-routes.ts", symbols: ["loginUser"] },
    { path: "src/auth/index.ts", symbols: ["loginUser", "LoginParams"] }
  ],
  metrics: {
    pageRank: 0.034,
    betweenness: 0.12,
    fanIn: 2,
    fanOut: 4,
    coupling: 0.6,
    tension: 0.0,
    isBridge: false
  }
}
```

**Why this matters for LLMs:** Everything needed to understand one file's role in the system. No need to read the actual file for structural understanding.

### 3. `get_dependents` — "What breaks if I change this?"

The "blast radius" tool. Critical for safe refactoring.

```
Input: { filePath: "src/utils/helpers.ts", depth: 2 }
Output: {
  file: "src/utils/helpers.ts",
  directDependents: [
    { path: "src/api/users.ts", symbols: ["formatDate"] },
    { path: "src/api/orders.ts", symbols: ["formatDate", "slugify"] },
    ...
  ],
  transitiveDependents: [
    { path: "src/pages/dashboard.tsx", throughPath: ["src/api/users.ts"], depth: 2 },
    ...
  ],
  totalAffected: 23,
  riskLevel: "HIGH"
}
```

**Why this matters for LLMs:** Before suggesting a change, LLM knows exactly what it would break. Enables confident refactoring suggestions.

### 4. `find_hotspots` — "Where are the problems?"

The "health check" tool. No input needed — returns top issues.

```
Input: { metric: "coupling" | "pagerank" | "fan_in" | "fan_out" | "betweenness" | "tension" | "escape_velocity", limit: 10 }
Output: {
  metric: "coupling",
  hotspots: [
    { path: "src/utils/helpers.ts", score: 0.94, reason: "47 dependents, 3 circular deps" },
    { path: "src/db/connection.ts", score: 0.87, reason: "used by every module" },
    { path: "src/api/middleware.ts", score: 0.82, reason: "fan-out: 12 imports" },
    ...
  ],
  summary: "3 files have coupling > 0.8. Consider splitting src/utils/helpers.ts."
}
```

**Why this matters for LLMs:** Instantly identifies where to focus attention. The `summary` field gives actionable advice the LLM can relay to the user.

### 5. `get_module_structure` — "Show me the architecture"

The "map" tool. Shows how the codebase is organized.

```
Input: { depth: 2 }
Output: {
  modules: [
    {
      path: "src/auth/",
      files: 8, loc: 1200,
      exports: 12, internalDeps: 15, externalDeps: 6,
      cohesion: 0.71,
      escapeVelocity: 0.12,
      dependsOn: ["src/db/", "src/utils/"],
      dependedBy: ["src/api/", "src/pages/"]
    },
    ...
  ],
  crossModuleDeps: [
    { from: "src/api/", to: "src/auth/", weight: 8 },
    { from: "src/pages/", to: "src/api/", weight: 14 },
    ...
  ],
  circularDeps: [
    { cycle: ["src/auth/", "src/db/", "src/auth/"], severity: "LOW" }
  ]
}
```

**Why this matters for LLMs:** High-level architecture map. LLM understands module boundaries, coupling direction, and circular dependencies without reading any source code.

### 6. `analyze_forces` — "What wants to be together and what wants apart?"

The "centrifuge" tool. Reveals architectural forces no other tool surfaces.

```
Input: { cohesionThreshold: 0.5, tensionThreshold: 0.3, escapeThreshold: 0.7 }
Output: {
  moduleCohesion: [
    { module: "src/auth/", cohesion: 0.71, internalDeps: 15, externalDeps: 6, verdict: "COHESIVE" },
    { module: "src/utils/", cohesion: 0.23, internalDeps: 3, externalDeps: 28, verdict: "JUNK_DRAWER" },
    ...
  ],
  tensionFiles: [
    {
      file: "src/shared/adapter.ts",
      tension: 0.82,
      pulledBy: [
        { module: "src/auth/", strength: 0.45, symbols: ["validateToken"] },
        { module: "src/billing/", strength: 0.40, symbols: ["chargeUser"] }
      ],
      recommendation: "Split into auth-adapter.ts and billing-adapter.ts"
    },
    ...
  ],
  bridgeFiles: [
    {
      file: "src/api/middleware.ts",
      betweenness: 0.67,
      connects: ["src/auth/", "src/db/", "src/logging/"],
      role: "Bridge between 3 otherwise-disconnected modules"
    },
    ...
  ],
  extractionCandidates: [
    {
      target: "src/logger/",
      escapeVelocity: 0.89,
      internalDeps: 1, externalDeps: 0,
      dependedByModules: 6,
      recommendation: "Extract to standalone @org/logger package — 0 deps on host codebase"
    },
    ...
  ],
  summary: "2 junk-drawer modules (utils, shared). 3 tension files need splitting. logger/ ready for extraction."
}
```

**Why this matters for LLMs:** No other tool provides this. LLM can tell a developer: "your utils/ is a junk drawer — split it" or "logger/ has zero internal deps — extract it as a package." Actionable architectural advice, not just visualization.

### Metric Definitions

| Metric | Formula | Range | What It Reveals |
|--------|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **PageRank** | Recursive link importance (damping=0.85) | 0→1 | "What's important?" — most-referenced files |
| **Betweenness** | Fraction of shortest paths through node | 0→1 | "What bridges clusters?" — remove it and clusters disconnect |
| **Coupling** | externalDeps / (internalDeps + externalDeps) per file | 0→1 | "How tangled?" — 1 = all deps are external |
| **Cohesion** | internalDeps / (internalDeps + externalDeps) per module | 0→1 | "Does this module belong together?" — 1 = fully internal |
| **Tension** | evenness of pull from 2+ modules (entropy-based) | 0→1 | "Is this file torn between modules?" — 1 = equally pulled by 2+ |
| **Escape Velocity** | (externalDependedBy) / totalDeps, low internalDeps | 0→1 | "Should this be its own package?" — 1 = everyone uses it, it uses nothing |

## Human Views (Top 6 — Browser Visualization)

All views share the same graph data. Switching views changes layout algorithm + visual encoding.

### 1. Galaxy View (Default) — "What's the shape of this codebase?"

```

- **Layout:** Module View base (clusters by directory)
- **Module borders:** solid blue = cohesive | dashed red = junk drawer (cohesion < 0.4)
- **Force arrows:** blue inward = centripetal | red outward = centrifugal (proportional to score)

- **Escape candidates:** dashed border with outward arrows, bold label "EXTRACT?"
- **Bridge files:** diamond shape instead of circle, tooltip shows which clusters they connect
- **Use case:** "What architectural refactoring should I do? What's misplaced?"

## Analysis

### Assumptions Challenged

| Assumption | Evidence For | Evidence Against | Verdict |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| TS compiler API is the best parser choice | Official, 100% accuracy on valid TS, handles all syntax | Slower than tree-sitter/babel, requires `typescript` as dep (~15MB) | VALID — accuracy > speed for V1 |
| 3d-force-graph is production-ready for this use case | 1.5k GitHub stars, wraps Three.js + d3-force-3d, handles interactive 3D graphs | Limited customization, may not handle >5k nodes well | RISKY — need performance testing early |
| Developers will install an npm package for visualization | Madge has 497k weekly downloads, dependency-cruiser 331k | Most devs use VS Code extensions or web tools, not CLIs | VALID — CLI + npx is the standard for dev tools |
| MCP integration adds significant value | LLMs need structured codebase data, MCP is the emerging standard | MCP adoption is still early, not all LLM tools support it | RISKY — value is real but audience is limited today |
| Function-level granularity is needed in V1 | User explicitly requested "every link between functions" | File-level may be sufficient for V1 MVP, function-level adds complexity | VALID — user requirement, but scope risk |

### Blind Spots

1. **[Integration]** How does the MCP server coordinate with the web server? Same process or separate? If same Express server, MCP protocol needs stdio or SSE transport — not HTTP REST.
   Why it matters: Wrong transport choice = MCP doesn't work with Claude Code or other clients

2. **[UX]** No mention of how to stop the server. Ctrl+C? Graceful shutdown? What happens to the browser tab?
   Why it matters: Poor DX if server doesn't clean up properly

3. **[Performance]** Function-level parsing could explode node count. A 200-file codebase could have 2000+ functions = 2200+ nodes + edges. Need aggressive clustering.
   Why it matters: Graph becomes unreadable and slow without LOD

4. **[Packaging]** Three.js + 3d-force-graph are large client-side bundles. How are they served? Bundled into the npm package? CDN? Built at install time?
   Why it matters: npm package size and install experience

### Failure Hypotheses

| IF | THEN | BECAUSE | Severity | Mitigation |
|----|------|---------|----------|------------|
| Codebase has >500 files with >2000 functions | 3D graph is unreadable spaghetti | Force-directed layout doesn't scale without clustering | HIGH | Default to file-level view, expand to function-level on click |
| MCP server uses wrong transport | Claude Code / Cursor can't connect | MCP requires stdio transport for local tools, not HTTP | HIGH | Use stdio transport via @modelcontextprotocol/sdk, test with Claude Code |
| User expects "any codebase" but only TS works | Negative first impression, abandoned | Package name suggests universality | MEDIUM | Clear README: "TypeScript/JavaScript V1, more languages planned" |

### The Real Question

Is this primarily a **visualization tool** (humans look at pretty 3D graphs) or an **analysis tool** (LLMs/humans query graph data for insights)?

**Recommendation:** Both — but weight analysis higher. The 3D visualization gets attention (demos well, shareable), but the MCP integration + bottleneck detection delivers daily value. Build the graph/analysis engine solid, treat the 3D renderer as one of multiple output modes.

### Open Items

- [question] MCP transport: stdio (for Claude Code CLI) or SSE (for web-based clients)? -> resolved: stdio for V1
- [gap] No CI/CD or release automation in scope -> no action (V2)
- [improvement] Consider `--json` flag to export graph data without server -> no action (V2)
- [risk] Function-level view may overwhelm users -> resolved: file-level default, expand to function-level on click
- [gap] No tests for parser accuracy against real-world codebases -> update spec (add integration test with fixture project)

## Notes

### Ship Retro (2026-02-18)
**Estimate vs Actual:** 10h -> ~2h (500% faster)
**What worked:** Greenfield build with clear spec — 19/19 scope items shipped in one iteration. Force analysis view and MCP tools were the differentiators. 75-test suite caught edge cases early.
**What didn't:** Nothing major. Config panel + dev mode were unplanned additions (post-V1 polish).
**Next time:** Include DX tooling (tsx watch, auto-reload) in initial scope — it accelerates iteration significantly.
